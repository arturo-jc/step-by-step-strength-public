# Step by Step Strength

This is a public version of the [Step by Step Strength](https://stepbystepstrength.com) frontend. All sensitive information has been stripped. It may be not up to date with the live version of the app.

## Setup

1. Run `npm i` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
3. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

Note: you will see a number of errors. This is because the frontend expects the backend to be listening on `http://localhost:4000/`, which it won't be. Nevertheless the guest mode should be mostly functional. Please disregard.
